# Code of Conduct

## ✦ Our Pledge
We, as stewards of the DevScape shrine, pledge to make participation in our community a respectful, safe, and welcoming experience for all.
We honor diversity of background, identity, and perspective. Every voice is valued, and every contribution is part of the living lore.

## ✦ Our Standards
Examples of behavior that strengthen the shrine:
- Offering respectful guidance and feedback.
- Celebrating the efforts of others, even in small steps.
- Using inclusive, clear, and kind language.
- Honoring the guardians (tests, lint, CI) before inscribing new scrolls.

Examples of behavior that disrupt harmony:
- Personal attacks, insults, or disrespectful language.
- Dismissing or belittling contributions.
- Harassment of any kind, public or private.
- Ignoring the guardians or bypassing rituals.

## ✦ Steward Responsibilities
Stewards are responsible for clarifying standards, addressing misconduct, and ensuring the shrine remains safe.
They may remove or reject contributions that violate this Code of Conduct.

## ✦ Scope
This Code applies within all project spaces — the archive, issues, pull requests, discussions, and any community gatherings.

## ✦ Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the shrine’s maintainers.
All complaints will be reviewed and addressed with fairness and confidentiality.

## ✦ Spirit of Stewardship
Remember: every scroll you inscribe is part of a greater story.
Treat others as fellow guardians of the shrine, and together we will keep DevScape resilient, welcoming, and luminous.
