## üìú Ceremonial Progress: The Arc of DevScape

The shrine of DevScape has been meticulously crafted through several phases, each sealing a vital aspect of its being:

-   **Phases 1‚Äì5: The Core Incantations**: The foundational entities, the whispers of AI dialogue, the rhythmic pulse of the event loop, the ethereal mood overlays, and the resilient spirit of Ollama have all been sealed into the shrine's core.
-   **Phase 6: The Scribe's Mandate**: The sacred rituals of logging, the meticulous export of contributor lineage, and the careful archiving of scrolls are now complete, ensuring the shrine remembers and honors its stewards.
-   **Phase 7: The Guardians' Vigil**: The final layer of self-defense has been inscribed, with CI hooks, linting, onboarding clarity, and help rituals now actively protecting the shrine against regressions and guiding new contributors.

With Phase 6 now green and guardians confirmed, DevScape not only moves, speaks, and feels, but also remembers, records, and honors its stewards.
